@defgroup pmic_driver PMIC: Power Management IC Driver
Module for the PMIC driver.

@details It is an SDK driver for the PMIC module of i.MX devices. PMIC users
should not call the PMIC driver functions directly. Instead, use the PMIC access
macros. This allows for quick PMIC change and dynamic PMIC binding.
